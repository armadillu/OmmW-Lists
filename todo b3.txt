## TODO ############################################################################
  
- BUG: script animations layer limbo, seems to be when i resign while animating? hard to repdroduce
- BUG: sometimes (very seldom) you can hear a sound type sound when launching the app. Dunno why!
- Prepare dialogs to get them spellchecked and proofed

## HALF DONE #######################################################################

- save animation should match the one that happens when pressing button (button not jumping, but fading color instead)

## NOT SURE ########################################################################

- Replace save/open panels for sheets?

## NOT POSSIBLE ####################################################################

- try soft edges on bottom and top of text box >> too much work not worth it
- Smaller memory usage, 104+ mb for a text editor is too much! >> might be the music loops? First beta used 109+ mb!

## TO QA ###########################################################################

- TEST: Chinese: hebrew arabic.....
- TEST: PPC
- TEST: Weird sound card? Apogee 
- BUG: parse UTF-8, macRoman, etc. make sure we suck everything in >> test on OSX 10.5? works fine on OSX 10.6
- BUG: minimize troublesome, try blocking fadeout

## DONE ############################################################################

- BUG: in very large documents, scrollbar handle could become too tiny to grab. Given it a min size now (like osx)
- CODE CLEANUP: OmmWriterController
- BUG: +Q MUST quit regardless
- FEATURE: Threaded Backup File saving
- FEATURE: Export as RTF >> those can be read with MS Word (Word has trouble reading .txt)
- BUG: Spaces support like writeroom
- FEATURE: minimize turns on "normal" mode, so we get Dock and menubars when minimize. This way we can launch back ommwriter when minimized but in front.
- Improvement: Windows actually close after fading out (less cpu usage when not using ommwriter)
- FEATURE: Added "Show Window" on menus
- 600+ Compiler warnings!
- BUG: Compiling on 10.6 SDK creates problems (CAKeyframeAnimationExtra)
- FEATURE: window level rises when about to resign active to allow nice fade on top of everything else, back to normal when done
- FEATURE: salt pagina al reach final - mirar is pot ser menys salt >> turned on Smooth Scrolling, helps a lot
- BUG: japanese no sound keystrokes until final char is inputted
- BUG: 2+ screens & disconnect 2nd screen >> remap properly to new screen size
- FEATURE: reset to standard box size in  menu
- FEATURE: PDF Export 
- FEATURE: much more smoother drag/resize box operation
- FEATURE: interlineado mas alto para la serif: 1.3. Implement different lineheight for each font style!
- BUG: replace file at save as!
- FEATURE: if OmmWriter detects it crashed last time it was used during launch time, it will present the "backup file" instead of an empty canvas.
- BUG: fixed situation where user was trying to "open a file" || "new document" || "quit", was asked to save its file first, 
 said yes, and then when asked where to save its, canceled. OmmWriter would quit regardless. (without saving!) 
- FEATURE: New document command ( + n)
- FEATURE: add +1 type size
- FEATURE: delayed word count / dont do word count if interface is hidden, do it on show interface
- BUG: typing speed is slow, look into optimizing "word count" and [string len] for every keystroke
- FEATURE: save file (+s) on screen feedback!
- BUG: scroll bar; grab where you grab, no jump on click
- FEATURE: when deleting chars in script font, the queue is aware of it (so your typos wont be "played back")
- FEATURE: black out other screens and add pref plist to disable (blackoutSecondaryScreens bool) >> improved performance with threading
- FEATURE: music fades out / stops when minimized
- BUG: ommwriter window level is too high. Try lowering to allow japanese input, make sure spellcheck panel works
- FEATURE: cursor as wide as letter to help read where cursor is (try full block)
- BUG: open 2+ files at once from finder confusing and leads to data loss
- BUG: edit file, save: on question say "don't save" and it will ask where to save
- BUG: Follow Apple Standard Guidelines on dialogs
- BUG: OmmWriter with 'W'
- FEATURE: "phantom car" animation for script font: when typing, u can see a "ghost" of it
- FEATURE: fall back to CoreAudio for music playback (was heavier quicktime b4) by switching to mp3 instead of m4a
