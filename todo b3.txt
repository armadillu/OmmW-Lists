## TO DO ###########################################################################
  
- BUG: sometimes (very seldom) you can hear a keytype sound when launching the app. Dunno why!
- Chromotherapy create animations
- Background with overlaid pngs!
- background messages / quotes
- background adapt to all screen sizes + crop if its a weird size
- new musics + sound effects?
- two versions paid & free!
- new font animations
- hansi bug report, select all and delete while text is being typed, stuck animation!
- 20, 22 and 24 animated font

## HALF DONE #######################################################################

- save animation should match the one that happens when pressing button (button not jumping, but fading color instead)

## NOT SURE ########################################################################

- Replace save/open panels for sheets?

## NOT POSSIBLE ####################################################################

- Box handle-squares randomly clipped on Mac OS X 10.5
- CharAnimationLayer (script font) background not transparent on Mac OS X 10.5
- try soft edges on bottom and top of text box >> too much work not worth it
- Smaller memory usage, 104+ mb for a text editor is too much! >> might be the music loops? First beta used 109+ mb!

## TO QA ###########################################################################

- FEATURE: give error when using 10.4
- TEST: Chinese, hebrew, arabic.....
- TEST: PPC
- TEST: Weird sound card? Apogee
- BUG: parse UTF-8, macRoman, etc. make sure we suck everything in >> test on OSX 10.5? works fine on OSX 10.6

## DONE ############################################################################

- BUG: replace would always save as .omm (even if user asked for rtf or pdf)
- Test on 10.5 machine; install 10.5 on an external hard drive to do some testing
- FEATURE: sticky setting for check spelling and grammar; chose it once, and it remembers on every relaunch.
- BUG: Scrollbar drag when text is shorter than box makes it scroll.
- BUG: minimize troublesome, fixed by blocking fadeout instead of NSTimers
- Prepare dialogs to get them spellchecked and proofed

- LICENSING: implement license check at start time and modify exposed interface accordingly

- FEATURE: New document command ( + n)
