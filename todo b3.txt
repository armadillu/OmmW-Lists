## TODO ############################################################################
  
- BUG: spaces and then +tab no torna!
- BUG: minimize troublesome, try blocking fadeout
- BUG: +Q MUST quit regardless
- prepare dialogs to get them spellchecked and proofed

## HALF DONE #######################################################################

- Command to minimize ( + m) >> we minimize but stay in ommwriter?
- BUG: SPACES, see how writeRoom it does it
- save animation should match the one that happens when pressing button (button not jumping, but fading color instead)

## NOT SURE ########################################################################

- Replace save/open panels for sheets?

## NOT POSSIBLE ####################################################################

- try soft edges on bottom and top of text box >> too much workm not worth it
- Smaller memory usage, 104+ mb for a text editor is too much! >> might be the music loops? First beta used 109+ mb!

## TO QA ###########################################################################

- TEST: Chinese: hebrew arabic.....
- TEST: PPC
- TEST: Weird sound card? Apogee 
- BUG: parse UTF-8, macRoman, etc. make sure we suck everything in >> test on OSX 10.5? works fine on OSX 10.6
