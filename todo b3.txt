## TO DO ###########################################################################

- BUG: sometimes (very seldom) you can hear a keytype sound when launching the app. Dunno why!
- background adapt to all screen sizes + crop if its a weird size
- textview change font or size really slow fade in/out on large docs, cache bitmap?
- When finding words, show scrollBar to know where we are! 

## HALF DONE #######################################################################

- save animation should match the one that happens when pressing button (button not jumping, but fading color instead)

## NOT SURE ########################################################################

- Replace save/open panels for sheets?

## NOT POSSIBLE ####################################################################

- Box handle-squares randomly clipped on Mac OS X 10.5
- CharAnimationLayer (script font) background not transparent on Mac OS X 10.5
- try soft edges on bottom and top of text box >> too much work not worth it
- Smaller memory usage, 104+ mb for a text editor is too much! >> might be the music loops? First beta used 109+ mb!

## TO QA ###########################################################################

- TEST: Chinese, hebrew, arabic.....
- TEST: PPC
- TEST: Weird sound card? Apogee
- BUG: parse UTF-8, macRoman, etc. make sure we suck everything in >> test on OSX 10.5? works fine on OSX 10.6
